The raw data of the expression profiling for lung tissues of severe COPD (n=111) and controls (n=40) were downloaded from NCBI GEO datasets (GSE76925) (Morrow et al., 2017). The Microarray data was background corrected, log2 transformed and quantile normalized.

We extracted the expression matrix (GSE76925_series_matrix.txt) and sample info (GSE76925_design.txt) from the files downloaded.

Then, we use limma to get the differential genes.
